Perfect approach 🚀 — you don’t need _all_ of math, just the essentials that directly connect to Big-O reasoning. I’ll break this into **atomic lessons** that build up from Algebra → Functions → Growth Rates → Big-O → Practice.

Here’s the roadmap:

# 📘 Roadmap to Master Big-O and Time Complexity

## 1. Math Prerequisites (Algebra Refresher)

1. **Basic arithmetic rules**: addition, multiplication, exponentiation, order of operations.
2. **Variables & expressions**: understanding `n`, `n+1`, `2n`, etc.
3. **Simplifying expressions**: combine like terms, drop lower-order terms.
4. **Exponents & logarithms basics**:

   - What is `log base 2`?
   - Rules like `log(ab) = log a + log b`.

5. **Inequalities & growth intuition**: why `2^n` grows faster than `n^2`.

---

## 2. Functions & Growth

6. **Functions as input → output**: `f(n) = n^2`, `f(n) = log n`.
7. **Comparing functions**: Which grows faster? (`n` vs `n^2` vs `2^n`).
8. **Orders of growth hierarchy**:

   - Constant < Logarithmic < Linear < Linearithmic < Quadratic < Polynomial < Exponential < Factorial.

## 3. Foundations of Complexity

9. **What is “time complexity”?** Counting _steps_, not seconds.
10. **Basic operations count**: assignment, loop iteration, recursion call.
11. **Input size `n`**: what does it mean for arrays, strings, graphs, etc.
12. **Best, Worst, Average case**: why Big-O usually means _worst case_.

---

## 4. Big-O Notation Proper

13. **Definition of Big-O**: `f(n) = O(g(n))`.
14. **Dropping constants**: why `3n` → `O(n)`.
15. **Dropping lower terms**: why `n^2 + n` → `O(n^2)`.
16. **Other notations**:

- Big-Ω (lower bound)
- Big-Θ (tight bound).

---

## 5. Time Complexity Patterns

17. **Common complexities**: `O(1)`, `O(log n)`, `O(n)`, `O(n log n)`, `O(n^2)`, `O(2^n)`.
18. **Analyzing loops**:

- Single loop → `O(n)`
- Nested loops → multiply complexities (`O(n^2)`)
- Sequential loops → add complexities (still `O(n)`).

19. **Conditionals & branching**: why `if` doesn’t change Big-O.
20. **Recursion analysis**:

- Linear recursion → `O(n)`
- Divide & conquer (e.g., mergesort) → `O(n log n)`.

## 6. Space Complexity

21. **What is space complexity?**
22. **Extra arrays, recursion stack space.**

---

## 7. Advanced Topics (Optional but Powerful)

23. **Master Theorem** (divide & conquer analysis).
24. **Amortized complexity** (e.g., dynamic arrays, hash maps).
25. **Complexity classes** (P, NP) → just awareness.

---

## 8. Practice & Intuition

26. **Analyzing real algorithms**:

- Linear search, binary search.
- Sorting (bubble, merge, quick).
- Hash table ops.
- Tree traversal.
- Graph BFS/DFS.

27. **Spotting dominant terms quickly**.
28. **Comparing algorithms**: why O(n log n) beats O(n^2).

👉 If you go through these **28 atomic lessons in order**, you’ll be able to look at _any_ algorithm and confidently say what its time complexity is.
