Perfect, Morteza 👍 — let’s design a **step-by-step challenge roadmap** that’ll take you from scratch in Python through all the **core data structures and algorithms (DSA)** you need for interviews.

We’ll keep it **progressive**, **grouped**, and **focused on interview-relevant topics** (not deep theory or research-level algorithms).

# 🎯 Outcome

By the end of **Challenge 50**, you will have implemented **all core data structures + most common interview algorithms** in Python. This is enough for FAANG-style interviews, coding challenges, and a strong foundation.

---

👉 Do you want me to also **turn this into a full 50-day plan (one challenge per day)** with increasing difficulty and checkpoints, or keep it as a free-flow checklist?

Exactly! Many interview problems aren’t about new data structures—they’re about **patterns/techniques** to solve problems efficiently. Let’s add a **“Problem-Solving Techniques”** section between arrays/strings and trees, so you can systematically practice them.

---

## **Extra Section: Problem-Solving Patterns & Techniques**

### **1. Two Pointers**

- ✅ Challenge 51: Reverse an array in-place
- ✅ Challenge 52: Remove duplicates from a sorted array
- ✅ Challenge 53: Container with most water (max area problem)
- ✅ Challenge 54: 3Sum / 3Sum closest

### **2. Sliding Window**

- ✅ Challenge 55: Maximum sum subarray of size K
- ✅ Challenge 56: Longest substring without repeating characters
- ✅ Challenge 57: Minimum window substring (classic problem)
- ✅ Challenge 58: Sliding window maximum (deque-based)

### **3. Fast & Slow Pointers**

- ✅ Challenge 59: Detect cycle in a linked list (Floyd’s)
- ✅ Challenge 60: Find start of cycle in linked list
- ✅ Challenge 61: Happy Number problem

### **4. Backtracking**

- ✅ Challenge 62: Generate all subsets (already in recursion, but emphasize backtracking)
- ✅ Challenge 63: Generate all permutations
- ✅ Challenge 64: N-Queens problem
- ✅ Challenge 65: Word search in a grid

### **5. Greedy Techniques**

- ✅ Challenge 66: Activity selection problem
- ✅ Challenge 67: Minimum number of coins (greedy version, if denominations allow)
- ✅ Challenge 68: Jump Game problem (can reach end)

### **6. Binary Search & Variants**

- ✅ Challenge 69: Binary search on a sorted array
- ✅ Challenge 70: First/last occurrence of element in sorted array
- ✅ Challenge 71: Search in rotated sorted array
- ✅ Challenge 72: Peak element in an array

### **7. Union-Find / Disjoint Set (optional, for graphs)**

- ✅ Challenge 73: Detect cycle in undirected graph
- ✅ Challenge 74: Number of connected components

---

If we **integrate this section**, the roadmap would flow like this:

1. Foundations → 2. Linked Lists → 3. Hashing → 4. Recursion → 5. Sorting → 6. Strings → **7. Patterns/Techniques** → 8. Trees → 9. Heaps → 10. Graphs → 11. DP

---

I can also **merge these techniques with the challenges above**, so you get a **linear roadmap of 75+ challenges in the exact order to solve**, ready to follow day by day.

Do you want me to do that next?
