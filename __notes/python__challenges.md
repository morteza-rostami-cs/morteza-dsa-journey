Perfect 👍 I get what you want: not pure DSA/math grind, but Python mastery + logic/problem-solving through **practical, creative challenges**.

Here’s a **progressive challenge roadmap** (titles + short descriptions). You can tackle them one by one, and later paste one here for full guidance/solution:

---

# 🐍 Python + Logic-Building Challenges

### **Stage 1 – Python Basics & Syntax**

1. **Echo CLI** – Write a program that repeatedly asks for input and echoes it back until "quit" is entered.
2. **Unit Converter** – Convert Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit, KM ↔ Miles. Practice functions + user input.
3. **Word Counter** – Take a string and count words, characters, and unique words.
4. **Simple To-Do List (CLI)** – Add, remove, and list tasks from memory.

---

### **Stage 2 – Data Structures in Practice**

5. **Phonebook Dictionary** – Store names + numbers, search/edit/delete entries.
6. **Text Analyzer** – Given text, count frequency of each letter/word.
7. **Shopping Cart Simulation** – Add items, compute total with discounts.
8. **Bracket Validator** – Check if `()[]{}` are balanced in a string.

---

### **Stage 3 – Logic & Flow Control**

9. **Rock-Paper-Scissors** – Human vs Computer with random choices.
10. **Number Guessing Game** – Computer picks random number, user guesses with hints.
11. **Dice Roller** – Simulate multiple dice rolls and compute probabilities.
12. **Password Strength Checker** – Validate length, numbers, symbols, etc.

---

### **Stage 4 – Functions, Modules & Files**

13. **File Word Searcher** – Search for a word inside a text file.
14. **JSON Notes App** – Save/load notes in a JSON file.
15. **Expense Tracker** – Track expenses, save/load from CSV.
16. **Markdown to HTML Converter (basic)** – Parse `# Headings` and `* lists` into HTML.

---

### **Stage 5 – Object-Oriented Python**

17. **Bank Account Class** – Deposit, withdraw, transfer between accounts.
18. **Library System** – Books + Users, borrow/return books.
19. **Shapes & Area Calculator** – Polymorphism with Circle, Rectangle, Triangle.
20. **Simple RPG Battle** – Player vs Enemy with HP, attack, defense stats.

---

### **Stage 6 – Advanced Python Features**

21. **Custom Decorator** – Log function execution time.
22. **Context Manager** – Write a class to open/close a resource.
23. **Iterator Challenge** – Build a custom iterator for Fibonacci numbers.
24. **Regex Extractor** – Extract all emails from a text file.

---

### **Stage 7 – Problem-Solving & Mini Projects**

25. **Sudoku Validator** – Check if a Sudoku grid is valid.
26. **Minesweeper Grid Generator** – Randomly place mines, show counts.
27. **Markdown Blog CLI** – Write blog posts in markdown, export to HTML.
28. **API Caller (requests)** – Fetch a joke or weather from a public API.
29. **Mini Web Scraper (BeautifulSoup)** – Extract all links from a webpage.
30. **Chatbot (basic)** – Rule-based responses with `if/else` + patterns.

---

### **Stage 8 – Capstone Challenges**

31. **File Explorer CLI** – Navigate folders, list/create/delete files.
32. **Tic-Tac-Toe with AI** – Implement player vs computer with minimax or random AI.
33. **Personal Budget App (OOP + Files)** – Track income, expenses, categories.
34. **Markdown Wiki (multi-file project)** – Create interconnected pages in markdown.
35. **Python Mini-Shell** – Run basic commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cat` using Python.

---

👉 By the end, you’ll have:

- Practiced **every Python feature** (loops, classes, decorators, iterators, files, regex, modules).
- Built **general problem-solving logic**.
- Written **mini-projects** that look like real-world apps.

Do you want me to **expand each challenge into a full problem statement with requirements** (like a coding exercise spec), or keep it short and only expand one when you paste it back?
