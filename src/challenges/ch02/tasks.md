Perfect 💯 — let’s break your **Advanced Number Guessing Game** into a roadmap of **atomic tasks**.
If you complete them one by one, you’ll end up with the full working game.

---

## 📝 Atomic Task List

### **Phase 1 — Core Setup**

1. **Create the game entry point**

   - A `main()` function that runs a loop with a simple text-based main menu:

     - `1. New Game`
     - `2. Exit`

   - For now, just print the menu and allow the user to quit.

2. **Implement player creation**

   - Prompt the player for their name when starting a new game.
   - Initialize their score to `0`.
   - Prepare a structure to track game history (guesses, hints, final score).

---

### **Phase 2 — Game Range & Number**

3. **Generate random upper bound**

   - Pick a random integer between `100` and `5000` as the game’s max number.
   - Display the range (e.g., “Guess a number between 1 and 2437”).

4. **Generate secret number**

   - Randomly select the secret number within the chosen range.
   - Keep it hidden from the player, but store it for game logic.

---

### **Phase 3 — Difficulty Levels**

5. **Implement difficulty selection**

   - Show difficulty menu: `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`.
   - Return which mode is chosen.

6. **Easy Mode guesses limit**

   - Always allow `30` guesses.

7. **Medium Mode guesses limit**

   - Calculate allowed guesses as `ceil(log₂(range))`.

8. **Hard Mode guesses limit + number shifting**

   - Same `log₂(range)` limit as Medium.
   - Add logic to shift the secret number by ±3 after each wrong guess (ensure it stays inside range).

---

### **Phase 4 — Game Loop**

9. **Implement guess input & validation**

   - Prompt the player for a number.
   - Validate input: must be an integer inside the current range.
   - Handle invalid input gracefully (retry instead of crashing).

10. **Check guess against secret number**

    - If correct → player wins.
    - If wrong → decrease remaining guesses, reduce score, possibly trigger number shift (Hard mode).

---

### **Phase 5 — Hint System (Easy Mode Only)**

11. **Track wrong guesses count**

    - Keep a counter of wrong attempts.

12. **Range hint after 3 wrong guesses**

    - Print a narrowed range (e.g., “The number is between 200 and 400”).

13. **Odd/Even hint after 5 wrong guesses**

    - Reveal whether the number is odd or even.

---

### **Phase 6 — Scoring System**

14. **Initialize player score**

    - Start with `1000` points at the beginning of each game.

15. **Deduct points for wrong guesses**

    - Subtract `50` points each time.

16. **Bonus for no hints used**

    - If the player wins without using hints, add `+200` points.

17. **End conditions**

    - Lose if guesses run out OR score ≤ 0.
    - Print final outcome (win/lose + final score).

---

### **Phase 7 — Game History**

18. **Track per-game stats**

    - Number of guesses used.
    - Hints used.
    - Final score.

19. **Store game history in player profile**

    - Keep a running list for each session.

---

### **Phase 8 — Leaderboard**

20. **Create a leaderboard file (`leaderboard.txt`)**

    - If file doesn’t exist, create it.
    - Store player name + score (append after each game).

21. **Load leaderboard on program start**

    - Read scores into memory.

22. **Save new scores after each game**

    - Update file with player’s latest score.

23. **Display top 5 leaderboard**

    - Sort scores descending.
    - Print only the best 5 at the end of each game.

---

### **Phase 9 — Replayability**

24. **Ask player to play again after game ends**

    - Option to return to menu without restarting the program.

25. **Loop back to main menu**

    - Player can start a new game with same profile OR exit.

---

✅ If you finish these **25 atomic tasks**, you’ll have the full advanced number guessing game with clean modular functions, leaderboard, and difficulty modes.

---

Do you want me to also **group these into implementation sprints** (like “do tasks 1–4 first, then test, then move on”), so you can tackle them in logical chunks instead of 25 isolated pieces?
