Perfect ðŸš€ â€” you want **atomic tasks** (micro-steps) that guarantee progress without overwhelm. Letâ€™s break **Lesson 1: Math Prerequisites (Algebra Refresher)** into a **checklist of atomic tasks**.

# âœ… Lesson 1: Math Prerequisites (Algebra Refresher) â€” Atomic Task List

### 1. Arithmetic Rules Refresher

- [ ] Review **order of operations** (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).
- [ ] Practice solving simple expressions: `3 + 4 * 2`, `(3 + 4) * 2`.
- [ ] Recall multiplication and division properties (commutative, associative, distributive).
- [ ] Practice: simplify `2 * (3 + 5)`, `(2*3) * 4`.

---

### 2. Variables & Expressions

- [ ] Understand a variable `n` as a placeholder for input size.
- [ ] Write and simplify expressions with `n`:

  - `n + 1`
  - `2n + 3n`
  - `n * (n + 1)`

- [ ] Practice: plug in sample values (e.g., `n=5`) and evaluate.

---

### 3. Simplifying Expressions

- [ ] Combine like terms: `2n + 3n = 5n`.
- [ ] Expand brackets: `(n+1)(n+2) = n^2 + 3n + 2`.
- [ ] Drop **smaller terms** when comparing growth:

  - Example: `n^2 + n â‰ˆ n^2` (for large `n`).

- [ ] Drop constants: `3n â‰ˆ n` (for complexity analysis).

---

### 4. Exponents & Logarithms Basics

- [ ] Recall exponent rules:

  - `a^m * a^n = a^(m+n)`
  - `(a^m)^n = a^(m*n)`
  - `a^0 = 1`.

- [ ] Understand logarithm definition: `log_b(a) = x â†” b^x = a`.
- [ ] Learn log rules:

  - `log(ab) = log a + log b`
  - `log(a^k) = k log a`.

- [ ] Practice with base-2 logs (since computers love binary):

  - `log2(8) = 3`, `log2(16) = 4`.

---

### 5. Inequalities & Growth Intuition

- [ ] Compare simple functions: check when `n^2 > n`, `2^n > n^2`.
- [ ] Use small values of `n` to test: plug in `n=2,3,4,5`.
- [ ] Build intuition:

  - Linear (`n`) vs quadratic (`n^2`)
  - Quadratic (`n^2`) vs exponential (`2^n`).

- [ ] Visualize (sketch or imagine) graphs: `n`, `n^2`, `2^n`.

---

ðŸ‘‰ After finishing these **atomic tasks**, youâ€™ll have the math foundation to confidently move into **Functions & Growth (Lesson 2)**.

Do you want me to **expand each atomic task into micro-tutorials with explanations + practice exercises** (like a workbook) for Lesson 1?
