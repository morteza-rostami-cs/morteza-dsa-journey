Got it üëç You don‚Äôt want the solution itself, just a **full problem description** like a coding challenge statement. Here‚Äôs one for **Challenge 54: 3Sum / 3Sum Closest** with clear constraints, input/output, and explanation:

# ‚úÖ Challenge 54: 3Sum / 3Sum Closest

## Problem Description

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Your task is to find three integers in `nums` such that their sum is **closest** to `target`.

* Return the sum of the three integers.
* You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

**Explanation:**
The sum that is closest to the target is `(-1 + 2 + 1) = 2`.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
nums = [0, 0, 0], target = 1
```

**Output:**

```
0
```

**Explanation:**
The only possible sum is `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

---

## Constraints

* `3 <= nums.length <= 500`
* `-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`
* `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

---

## Notes

* The problem is a variation of the **3Sum** problem.
* Unlike the standard 3Sum (which finds triplets that sum to exactly zero), here you are required to return the **closest possible sum** to the given target.
* Efficient solutions generally use **sorting + two pointers** to reduce time complexity from O(n¬≥) (brute force) to O(n¬≤).

---

Do you also want me to write a **separate problem description for the standard 3Sum (sum to zero)**, so you have both versions clear for your challenge list?
